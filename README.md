# pyxell_agent


Develop an Al-powered agent that can automate tasks on various websites through a simple web app interface. Here's a breakdown of the requirements:

1. **Basic Functionality**:

**Simple Interface**: The app should have a straightforward interface.

**Sections**

- **Save Credentials**: A section for saving login credentials.

**Document Management**: A section for managing documents.

- **History Section**: A section to track task history.

2. **Task Automation**:

The agent should be capable of performing tasks on any website, not just pre-programmed ones.

An example task is creating a Zoom

account, scheduling a meeting, and providing

the meeting link. The agent should acknowledge tasks with responses like "OK, it is done."

3. **Technical Implementation**:

- Use the GPT-4 API for task automation.

The agent should control the browser, not the entire PC or mobile device.

4. A simple Ul that we can integrate into Pyxell.ai
